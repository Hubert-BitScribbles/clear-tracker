# Changelog

The version shows in Settings → About and in "Report a problem", so a report
can be matched to what was live. The number lives in `package.json`; update it
on the branch, before merging.

## 1.0.0-rc.2 — 6 October 2026

From the first tests on iPhone and Mac.

- Help → Contact: the "Send feedback" button's text was invisible (the
  same colour as the button). Contact now asks people not to include health
  or personal details beyond how to reach them, and says what a problem
  report includes.
- Onboarding no longer appears again once set up. The installed app could
  open on the onboarding address, and going through it again re-saved this
  week's intention, sounds and region.
- Onboarding's practice day shows its month and year, and says to tap it.
- Text fields and menus are 16px, so iPhone no longer zooms in on them (the
  Region menu in onboarding left the app zoomed).
- On a computer, Export saves the backup: Chrome and Edge ask where, other
  browsers put it in Downloads. It had opened the Mac share sheet, which
  can't save. Phones still use the share sheet.

## 0.1.0 — release candidate 1, 6 October 2026

First public build of the web app.
